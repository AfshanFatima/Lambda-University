# [4th Lecture](https://youtu.be/sqf1bh7kD3I) w/Sean Checn: LS-Client-Auth Intro
- https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Client-Auth-mini
- Sessions vs JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- w/JWT, client handles State instead of server maintaining each clients session data
- JWT adds more complexity to the client, Sessions maight be simpler to implement, but not as scalable
- https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken
- https://github.com/expressjs/session

- Window.localStorage
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage

- CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
- https://github.com/expressjs/cors
- Same origin policy: same protocol, host and port
- expressjs cors middleware
- production use case, usually only add cors to routes you want to be public

- React Higher Order Components
- available only to authenticated users
