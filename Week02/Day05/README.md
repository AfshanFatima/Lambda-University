# 1st Lecture - Ryan Hamblin
## [Section 1](#): `bind()` (& `class`)
- [bind.js](Week02/Day05/bind.js)
- `bind()` is a way to control the context of what `this` refers to
- some `class` stuff @ tail of lecture...

## [Section 2](#): Week 1 Homework Review, Advanced JS: "class.js"
- [class.js](Advanced-JavaScript/src/class.js)
- Q: how to solve using prototype methods?

## [Section 3](#): Week 1 Homework Review, Advanced JS: "objects.js"
- [bind.js](Advanced-JavaScript/src/objects.js)
- object methods
- object elements are NOT indexed
- instead of for loops, we use Objects.keys to return an array (list) of all the keys
