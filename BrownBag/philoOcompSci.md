# philosophy of computer science

This lecture is just a review of some concepts which have helped me to advance in my endeavors with computer science by means of analysis, or, just breaking things down into their constituent parts to see how they all fit together.

## What is philsophy?
  - some use the term to mean "our way of looking at things" or "how we'd like the world to be"
  - I will be using the term philosophy in the sense of the translation from the Greek:

### "love of wisdom"
#### in the sense of the tranlsation:
  1. "philo-" means love, but not in the way we might mean romantic love;
  2. "philo-" is more aking to:
    -  Respect
    -  Reverence
    -  Virtue
  3. "-sophy" means _wisdom_
  4. ... in short philsophy translates to (is) the virtue of or respect for wisdom.

#### So what is "wisdom"?
  1. At it's core wisdom requires _knowledge_.
  2. Wisdom, in fact, _obtains_ knowledge.

#### So what is "knowledge"?
  1. In the past 2500+ years, many have tried to construe knowledge into something to do with "beliefs which are both justified and true". This is hogwash and an open door to all sorts of nonsense.
  2. Knowledge is quite mundane, imperfect and limited: knowledge simply is _empirical verification_
    - "Empirical verification" is just a way of saying: confirmation by observation; through the senses: sight, sound, touch, taste and for better or worse, smell.

#### SO, in short: philosophy of is _respect for obtaining observational verification_
  1. In particular, observational verification of what is, the case, states of affairs, i.e. _that which is observationally verifiable_, e.g. **the world** (from subatomic decoherence to astronomical event horizons)
  2. In this sense:
    - philsophy is not an -ology, an area of study
    - the history of phiosophy and philosophers is not philosophy
    - philosophy is heuristic, not interpretive. Philosophy is not a matter of agreement, the respect for obtaining knowledge _enables_ learning.
    - To enable learning, philosophy contends not with opinion or sentiment, but with what is the case and what can be said of the case and it does so in terms of true or false.
  3. the **purview** of philsophy is: *logic, reason and rhetoric*
    - _Rhetoric_ is just a fancy way of saying, "use your words."
    - _Reason_ is basically just the art of using logic to deduce, induce and abduce (and abduce is just a fancy way of saying, "guessing").
    - _Logic_ is just the artifice, or, set of tools which we use to reason.
  4. the **domains** of philosophy are:
    - Epistemology, or the study of knowledge and statements of knowledge, and
    - Ontology, the study of reality, or what exists.

#### So what is the philosophy of computer science?
  1. In short: respect for obtaining knowledge with and of computer science.
  2. So what is computer science?
  3. Well, _science_ is, in no particular order:
     - observation
     - hypothesis, and
     - peer review
  4. SO, if you have repsect for obtaining knowledge with computational observation, hypothesis and peer review, then you are doing computer science and may even be meaningfully referred to as _a computer scientist_ (degree and PhD's regardless!)


## Things to review
1. Truth - a condition of propositions; the correspondence of what is said is the case and what actually is the case
2. Hypothesis: a guess can be an hypothesis, but hypotheses which are both verifiable and falsifiable are generally more apt to advance a knowledge claim
3. It is worth distinguishing statements of what is true from what is "true to you" (or true to me, or true to them or true to us). Statements of what is true are verifiable and falsifiable, for example, the statement "it is raining" could be true or false depending on the climate conditions of the person making the claim. Statements of what is "true to..." [you; me; us, or them] are basically statements of opinion, belief, sentiment, aesthetics, ethics, etc. All well and good, but categorically distinct from statments which are exclusively either true or false. It may be true to you that Bill Clinton was a better President than Ronald Reagan, and it may be true to someone else that Reagan was a better President. Whatever the opinion, however, the statement that "Ronald Reagan is the President of these united States" was true in the 1980s, but if the statement is false is claimed today.
4. To illustrate: if what is true and what is "true to you" were no different, then an oasis and a mirage would have both epistemic and ontological equivalence. They do not.

## Useful tools for analysis
1. Truth Tables
  - and
  - or (inclusive)
  - or (exclusive)
  - if > then (principle of explosion)
2. Backus-Naur form and Extended BNF
  - context-free grammar
  - but basically like what we do in programming when we think of how an expression will get reduced to a true or false value, or how a variable is used in a way that it gets evaluated into a value.
  - another example is how I broke down the translation of philosophy into "respect for obtaining knowledge" ;)

## For example
1. given what I know (i.e. my background) about the console, if I type a command, it is my hypothesis that entering that command will return a result.
2. Really basic stuff.
3. Then I can make a knowledge claim, e.g. "it is true that when I enter this command, such and such results will follow."
4. That statement is either true or false.
5. Anyone else can then know if that statement corresponds to the case, i.e. is true, by simply verifying the hypothesis, i.e. by entering the command and seeing if the predicted results occur.
6. hypothesis, peer review, observation.

## NOTE
- I'm not trying to construct some grandiose or profound notion of capital T truth or capital P philosophy.
- I just find that it is useful to explicitly articulate these really basic, fundamental things because, unlike a simple console command, compurter science and the rest of the world gets very complicated, ambiguous and confusing really quickly.
- When I am lost or overwhelmed, I can use the analytial tools to find solid ground from which to reorient or build upon.

## To end, I will leave you with the three kinds of knowledge and the three answers to every question, "why?"
### Three kinds of empirical verification:
1. Axiomatic, or, self evident knowledge
  - e.g. "dividends require financing" or "2 + 2 = 4"
  - things which are true by definition
  - also, tautologies, basically things which are saying the same thing backwards and forwards, e.g. many things may add up to four, but the statement "4 = 2 + 2" is the same statement as "2 + 2 = 4"
2. Empirical Knowledge
  - you can backus-naur this into _empirically verifible empirical verification_ if you really want to
  - e.g. "brute" facts, such as "the earth is ~93 million miles from the sun" or "the bell of Big Ben weighs 13,760 kilograms."
  - e.g. "institutional" facts such as "Brad and Angelina are divorced" or "Bernie Sanders a Senator from Vermont"
3. Self-knowledge
  - e.g. "I feel glad", "that tickles" or "I'm thirsty"
  - self knowledge is essentially knowledge of the self _by_ the self.
  - I don't mean some deep, introspective intuition, I just mean the things a self can verify about their own self.
  - This one particular kind of knowledge, for better or worse, is **only** verifiable by the self and no others. Someone else can agree with me when I say, "I feel glad" and they may observe my demeanor and behaviour and presume as much, but this is categorically distinct from anyone else empirically verifying my self-knowledge.
  - This aspect of what is sometimes called the irreducible first-person ontology of consciousness presents and epistemic limitation. But I digress.

### Three answers to every question, "why?"
1. Why not?
2. Because...
 - Often when "why?" is aksed in place of "how?" there actually is a cause which can be cited, but "because" can be ambiguous. For example:
 - Q: "Because I am cold" answers two different questions very differently
   1. A: "Why are you shivering?"
   2. A: "Why are you putting on your sweater?"
   - In the former case, _cause_ is cited, in the second case, _reason_.
3. You have to figure that out for yourself, silly!
