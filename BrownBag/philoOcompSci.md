# philosophy of computer science

This lecture is just a review of some concepts which have helped me to advance in my endeavors with computer science by means of analysis, or, just breaking things down into their constituent parts to see how they all fit together.

## What is philsophy?
  - some use the term to mean "our way of looking at things" or "how we'd like the world to be"
  - I will be using the term philosophy in the sense of the translation from the Greek:

### "love of wisdom"
#### in the sense of the tranlsation:
  1. "philo-" means love, but not in the way we might mean romantic love;
  2. "philo-" is more aking to:
    -  Respect
    -  Reverence
    -  Virtue
  3. "-sophy" means _wisdom_
  4. ... in short philsophy translates to (is) the virtue of or respect for wisdom.

#### So what is "wisdom"?
  1. At it's core wisdom requires _knowledge_.
  2. Wisdom, in fact, _obtains_ knowledge.

#### So what is "knowledge"?
  1. In the past 2500+ years, many have tried to construe knowledge into something to do with "beliefs which are both justified and true". This is hogwash and an open door to all sorts of nonsense.
  2. Knowledge is quite mundane, imperfect and limited: knowledge simply is _empirical verification_
    - "Empirical verification" is just a way of saying: confirmation by observation; through the senses: sight, sound, touch, taste and for better or worse, smell.

#### SO, in short: philosophy of is _respect for obtaining observational verification_
  1. In particular, observational verification of what is, the case, states of affairs, i.e. _that which is observationally verifiable_, e.g. **the world** (from subatomic decoherence to astronomical event horizons)
  2. In this sense:
    - philsophy is not an -ology, an area of study
    - the history of phiosophy and philosophers is not philosophy
    - philosophy is heuristic, not interpretive. Philosophy is not a matter of agreement, the respect for obtaining knowledge _enables_ learning.
    - To enable learning, philosophy contends not with opinion or sentiment, but with what is the case and what can be said of the case and it does so in terms of true or false.
  3. the **purview** of philsophy is: *logic, reason and rhetoric*
    - _Rhetoric_ is just a fancy way of saying, "use your words."
    - _Reason_ is basically just the art of using logic to deduce, induce and abduce (and abduce is just a fancy way of saying, "guessing").
    - _Logic_ is just the artifice, or, set of tools which we use to reason.
  4. the **domains** of philosophy are:
    - Epistemology, or the study of knowledge and statements of knowledge, and
    - Ontology, the study of reality, or what exists.

#### So what is the philosophy of computer science?
  1. In short: respect for obtaining knowledge with and of computer science.
  2. So what is computer science?
  3. Well, _science_ is, in no particular order:
     - observation
     - hypothesis, and
     - peer review
  4. SO, if you have repsect for obtaining knowledge with computational observation, hypothesis and peer review, then you are doing computer science and may even be meaningfully referred to as _a computer scientist_ (degree and PhD's regardless!)


## Things to review
1. Truth - a condition of propositions; the correspondence of what is said is the case and what actually is the case
2. Hypothesis: a guess can be an hypothesis, but hypotheses which are both verifiable and falsifiable are generally more apt to advance a knowledge claim

## Useful tools for analysis
1. Truth Tables
2. Backus-Naur
