> "Building a derivation in a context-free grammar is inherently a nondeterministic process. In transforming a variable, any rule with the variable on the left-hand side may be applied. The breadth-first parsers built a search tree by applying all permissible rules, while the depth-first parsers explored derivations initiated with one rule and backed up to try another whenever the search was determined to be a dead-end."
