- process scheduler (time share)
- see: `top` & `ps` (process status)
  - e.g. `$ ps -A`
- BOOT, Power On Self Test (POST), Built In Operating System (BIOS), Master Boot Record(MBR), initial kernel process excutes
- Operating System Kernel > Kernel system process > Load programs for: Process Scheduling, Memory Management, File table, Drivers(I/O) > LOOP
- Kernel level system commands

# [5th Lecture](https://youtu.be/upqmNSdpHi4) w/Thomson Comer: Operating Systems
- NIC: network interface card
- re: peripherals, Kernel talks to Drivers
- Memory Manager
- File Table Manager
- Process Scheduler
- System calls can only be made in C (or assembly)
- How to get answers for C when using it?
- vim hex mode: `:%!xxd`
- `$ echo $?` will display the return value of the compiled C program file
- if C program returns other than 0, that's a msg that something went wrong.
