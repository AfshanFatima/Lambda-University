# [2nd Lecture](https://youtu.be/vd5rosQ_8zI) w/Sean Chen: LS-Operating Systems: Scheduling
- How does the OS schedule processes? For simplicity, single CPUs
- Algorithms for different ways to schedule (long processes vs short, etc)
1. First In First Out: inefficient, just based on order, doesn't account for priority or size of process
2. SJF (Shortest Job First): also not great
  - Turnaround time: time between it being ready and when it actually finishes
  - Fairness (response time - when process is ready and when it is scheduled)
3. Round Robin: turnaround time suffers, but response time is favored
  - multi level feedback queue
  - priotiry levels
  - learns over time
