# [3rd Lecture](URL) w/Ryan Hamblin: DOM Sprint
- JavaScript history: how to deal with the DOM (backinnaday)
- Brendan Ike dubbed it (partly because Java was severside)
- Document Object Model
  - object oriented model which refers to documents (files)
  - reading files and turning them into web pages
  - DOM createss a big ol' tree.
- the DOM reads in HTML/CSS/JS and spits out the web page HTML tree.
- React works in a "virtual DOM"
- in the DOM the "nodes" are the ELEMENTS
- ELEMENTS have attributes which get assigned value:pair mapping
## using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from within the directory to display the webpage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head> <!-- This is where stuff lives which does NOT get displayed to the user -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

- head and body are "SIBLING ELEMENTS" & html their parent
- ! means important. ! with -- --, anything between the -- -- is ignored!
- HTML is layout/architecture/foundation, CSS is painting, placement of furniture, art on the walls, JS is the electricity in the house

## CSS Box Model Principle
- semantic markup: naming things what they are

```css
html, body{
  margin: 0;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  background-color: yellowgreen;
}

.wrapper-div {
  background-color: salmon;
  height: 700px;
  width: 500px;
}
```

-PADDING affects elements inside, MARGIN outside the element
-pseudo selectors, nth-child, etc CSS3 magic


## JS
- ES6 should work, if not, try ES5
